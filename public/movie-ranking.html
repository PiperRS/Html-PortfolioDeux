<h1>The Best Movies According to Risa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>The story of Frodo and his journey to save Middle Earth will forever be my favorite.</p>
<h3>Death Becomes Her</h3>
<p>This dark comedy had me laughing since I was a teenager. To this day, I can recite every line word for word!</p>
<h3>True Lies</h3>
<p>Arnold and Jamie Lee make the perfect match in this spy thriller. Loved this movie since I was a kid. <br />The tango dance is an epic plus at the beginning and end of the movie.</p>
